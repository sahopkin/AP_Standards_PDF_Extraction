    "# Pulling Standards from AP Course PDFs\n",
    "This notebook works through using the pdfplumber package to parse through pages of AP course description guides to pull out all content standards.  This particular page works through pages from the AP Computer Science course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE:  The two AP English courses follow a format that is different than most of the other courses.  A specialized script must be used for them.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup the intial run through\n",
    "Begin by importing:\n",
    "* `pdfplumber` to parse pages of the pdf\n",
    "* `re` to utilize regular expressions for pulling out standard identifiers\n",
    "* `pandas` to convert the final 2-D list into a dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pull_standards_tables()` function searches each page for the terms 'ENDURING UNDERSTANDING' OR 'LEARNING OBJECTIVE'.  If either of those terms exist on the page, it pulls the page tables, and checks to see if either of the terms are present as the 0-index element of a sub-list.  If either are, the sub-list is popped and appended into the empty array `all_pages_contents`.  The function returns the `all_pages_contents` array."
